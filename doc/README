#PREPARING ADC SPECTRUM
#======================
#SETUP: Anode Current -> Ch 0 on V1729A
#       Pulser -> EXT TRIG on V1729A
# !!!SIGNALS MUST NOT BE ON BOARD BEFORE THE PROGRAM SAYS TO ATTACH THEM!!!
# WD: /home/brandon/coding/vme_daq


# You have the option of starting another acquisition based on the parameter "num_quadrants".
# To do this, change "num_quadrants" in the file "src/main.c" to
# how many times you want to loop num_acquisitions ----------------------------------------------set to 40
Note: "num_acquisitions" can be used to acquire different amounts of data.

# Another important parameter is "trig_lev" in "src/main.c" which is a linear function of   
# the external trigger threshold (given in the src file) ranging from 0x0 (-1 V) to 0xFFFF(1V). 
# It must be set in hex. The program triggers on rising edge.

# To Run program
cd /home/brandon/coding/vme_daq/
./bin/adc_spectrum

#All the data is stored as a continuous ASCII text file. 
cd /home/brandon/coding/analysis/
mkdir [INSERT_DESCRIPTIVE_FOLDER_NAME]
mv  [file_name] [folder_name]
python /home/brandon/coding/analysis/scripts/plot.py [BARE_PMT_FILE] [BLANK_QUARTZ_FILE] [COATED_QUARTZ_FILE]

Be careful to move any files you make to either a different folder or different name because if you run the readout multiple times it will append to the same file.
#You may have to change the "padding" variable in plot.py  depending on the 
#width of the distribution.


#PLATEAU TESTING
#===============
#SETUP: Anode Current -> Ch 0 on V812 
#       "OR" on V812 -> Ch 0 INPUT on VX2718  
#
# WD: /home/brandon/coding/counting/
#
# Observe Anode current on Oscilloscope to determine a proper discriminator threshold.
# Can change threshold, output pulse width of discriminator, and the dead time of the
# discriminator in file "src/counting.C". Other parameters one can change are the
# style settings for ROOT, the num_voltages being tested, and the "num_repeats" for
# statistics. If anything is changed just do "make" in /home/brandon/coding/counting 
#
# You must ensure the LED isn't over-powered. If you see results that show counts as high 
# as 1023 for low voltages then the LED is too strong and needs its amplitude lowered. You 
# can somewhat eyeball this by looking at the LED on the "OR" from the Discriminator. 
#
# The scaler only has the capability to read up to 1023 counts. 
#
# Data is saved to "plateau.root"

# To Run program
cd /home/brandon/coding/counting
./bin/counting.exe

 Data is saved to "plateau.root"

# Press enter after adjusting the voltage level. I arbitrarily say 100V but we can 
# decide to change that.
